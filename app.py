"""Deployment entrypoint.

Vercel's Python runtime looks for a top-level `app` in one of a few known
filenames -- this is one of them -- and routes every request to it. Nothing
here is needed to run locally; use `news-classifier-serve` for that.

The sys.path line is deliberate. This project uses a src/ layout, so
`news_classifier` is only importable once the project itself is installed
(which `uv sync` does). Prepending src/ makes the import work either way,
rather than failing at cold start if the build only installed dependencies.
